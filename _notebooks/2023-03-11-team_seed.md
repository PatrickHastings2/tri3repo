## Team Seed

### Team member
- Yuyang Hsu(Aaron): I am more good at frontend than backend, so in a project, I will be more focus on frontend, but I will help on backend. In a group, I am easy to communicate with so we can get work done as a group more efficiently.
- Ninaad: I worked on both frontend and backend throughout this course, but most importantly I learned how to work as a team and be more adaptable.
- Patrick: I worked on mostly backend but ready to learn other things. I am looking forward to learn more this trimester
